This repository is the [author's personal GitHub repository](https://github.com/doctordns/PowerShellCookBook2019).

## Current status

This repo contains final working code. During the production process, some printed code has been improved for layout. 
So some changes are to be expected

This covers setting up a pull server and configuring partial configurations.

**Chapter 11, Managing Hyper-V** demonstrates the use of Hyper-V. This chapter shows you
how to build and deploy VMs with Hyper-V.
This includes nested Hyper-V running a Hyper-V VM inside another Hyper-V VM which is useful for a number of scenarios.

**Chapter 12, Managing Azure** looks at managing IAAS and PAAS resources in Azure using
PowerShell.
To test the recipes in this chapter, you need access to Azure.

**Chapter 13, Managing Performance and Usage** shows you how to measure, monitor, and report on the performance of your Windows 2019 servers. 
There are several recipes that demonstrate how to get specific performance measurements and how to create graphs of performance for further analysis.
